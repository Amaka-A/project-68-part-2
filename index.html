        about lamar cISD/ achievements
    </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> 
    Community involvement is one of the keys to the success of Lamar CISD. Whether it's supporting students at athletic and cultural events, approving the construction of new schools, the many volunteers who help our teachers and students on a daily basis, the men and women serving on advisory committees or those supporting the Lamar Educational Awards Foundation with financial contributions, our community is what makes Lamar CISD a great place to raise a family.

Lamar CISD will always focus on putting students first. Our campuses are designed with smaller enrollments (high schools are designed for no more than 2,000 students) to provide more opportunities for students to assume leadership roles and participate in campus activities. Lamar CISD also has sixth-grade-only campuses (middle schools) which focus on the needs of pre-adolescents, providing a smooth transition to secondary schools.

Lamar CISD is proud to be an HEB Excellence in Education Large District winner. We're home to National Principals of the Year, Gates Millennium Scholars, National Blue Ribbon Schools, Rodeo Art Grand Champions, State Athletic Champions and we're a recent member of the comptroller's Honors Circle for financial and academic excellence.

Lamar CISD has also passed four bond referendums over the past 15 years, while maintaining one of the lowest tax rates in the Houston area.

We already know Lamar CISD is a special place and we think you'll agree. Please browse this website to learn more about Lamar CISD, our students and our many programs. If you can't find what you need please feel free to contact Community Relations at (832)223-0330.</p>
